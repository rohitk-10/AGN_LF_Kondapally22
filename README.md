# Radio-AGN and LERG luminosity functions from Kondapally et al. 2022

This repository provides machine readable versions of the luminosity functions presented in Kondapally et al. 2022. The data come from the first data release of the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey Deep Fields.

## Data format

The luminosity functions are provided for 4 source classes (with column name structure as follows): 
 - LERGs (*lergs*) 
 - LERGs hosted by quiescent galaxies (*lergs\_Q*)
 - LERGs hosted by star-forming galaxies (*lergs\_SF*)
 - Radio-excess AGN (*agn*)

The luminosity functions for each redshift bin are provided in separate files. In each case, the luminosities quoted are at 150 MHz (in W Hz^-1; logged units), generated by assuming a spectral index alpha = -0.7. The space density values reported are in units of Mpc^-3 logL^-1 (in logged units).
